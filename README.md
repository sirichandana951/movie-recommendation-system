# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System! This project uses machine learning to suggest movies you'll love based on your preferences, ratings, and viewing history. Whether you're into rom-coms, thrillers, or obscure indie films, this system aims to be your personal movie concierge.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on genre, cast, and plot similarity.
- 👥 Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on user ratings and behavior.
- 🧠 Hybrid Model: Combines both approaches for smarter recommendations.
- 📊 Interactive Dashboard (optional): Visualize recommendations and user data.
- 🗃️ Scalable Dataset Support: Works with MovieLens, IMDb, or custom datasets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
pip install -r requirements.txt

##🪪 Dataset
This project uses the MovieLens dataset for training and evaluation. You can also plug in your own dataset by following the format in data/.
📈 Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- Precision@K / Recall@K
- Cosine Similarity Scores



📚 How It Works
The system analyzes movie metadata and user ratings to build a profile of your preferences. It then compares this profile against a database of movies to find the best matches. Collaborative filtering uses matrix factorization to uncover hidden patterns in user behavior.

🧠 Future Improvements
- Integrate deep learning models (e.g., autoencoders, transformers)
- Add support for real-time recommendations
- Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Mobile app interface
